# My Portfolio

This the code for my portfolio website, which was initially coded in simple HTML and CSS but later I translated it to React as I learned the technology. Of course it took me long to code it but the result was worth the time for me as I almost cloned it exactly as it was in the sample portfolio web side. 
Morever, I will be improving it further along the way as I will be learning new features and technologies.
